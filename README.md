#Assignment 02
##Katherine Cummings

For this assignment, the code here is used to pull and process data from both a photon magnetic door sensor and a photoresistor.

Included in this repository are two basic graphs, one for each sensor's data and a pair of visualizations of the data.

To complete this assignment, I used the paper.js library.
