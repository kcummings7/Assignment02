#Assignment 02
##Katherine Cummings

For this assignment, the code here is used to pull and process data from both a photon magnetic door sensor and a photoresistor. Both sensor's data is read by the photon and sent to the HTML page by JSON via WiFi.

Included in this repository are two basic graphs, one for each sensor's data and a pair of visualizations of the data.
While the graph visualization is an improvement on the code from IA1, the Lightbulb and Visitor Counter both are original to this assignment.  The Lightbulb visualization is a small graphic of a dim lightbulb that gradually becomes colored more yellow and then white proportional to the ambient light readings from the photosensor.  The Visitor Counter draws a number of stick figures onto the screen according to the number of times the magnetic door switch is opened.

To complete this assignment, I used the paper.js library.

An image of the photon's layout can be found under issues.
